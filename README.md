# 🌱 MediBot – Healthcare Management System

MediBot is an IoT-based system that uses sensors to monitor environmental conditions. An AI model analyzes these readings to check whether the environment is safe or if it may lead to risks. The system provides alerts when conditions become risky and also stores historical data to help users understand environmental changes over time.

## ⭐ What MediBot Does
- Monitors environmental conditions
- Uses AI to detect unsafe conditions
- Predicts potential risks
